If they‚Äôre of benefit to you in any way that is great. But truth be told, this is supposed to be of utility for myself, or at the very least a bit of documentation to see where my interest has been caught.\nI came across most of these resources on Mastodon via the creator or a reblogger. Others I picked up from the excellent R Weekly podcast. Yet more are recommendations from my colleagues, or treasures discovered during the bouts of frantic googling that is my job as a technical analyst."

It contains not just the spatial data for drawing polygons on maps, but also fields like LAD codes/names, which can be used as join keys with other public datasets such as those on the DWP‚Äôs Stat-Xplore.\n\n\n{sf}\nThis seems to be one of the main geospatial data packages in R. Apparently it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúspatial data simplified‚Äù, which I guess is a play on the whole simple features thing. To be honest I could only get it working in the most absolutely simple scenario. I found the docs far, far too daunting for the speed I had to operate for work, and in the end it was (unsurprisingly) google and Stack Overflow that got me sorted. I‚Äôm a rank novice with geospatial stuff so my struggle is more a comment on my knowledge than the sf docs themselves.\n\n\n{leaflet}\nLeaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for making interactive maps. And of course, there is an R binding, because people are wonderful üò≠. It was surprisingly straightforward once I had my spatial data in. Thankfully there are some excellent examples on the package site, and as I needed to make a choropleth (not that I knew it was called that) for a Shiny app, I just stole the example code and tweaked it for my own purposes!\n\nTotal Amount of Benefit per ward, City of Edinburgh (fictional data)\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nward_shp <- sf::read_sf(\"data/WD_DEC_22_GB_BGC.shp\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84')\n\nmy_ward <- \"City of Edinburgh\"\n\n# Random numbers to represent a fictional benefit\nbenefit <- tibble::tibble(\n  WD22CD = dplyr::pull(dplyr::filter(ward_shp, LAD22NM == my_ward), WD22CD),\n  benefit_value = rnorm(length(WD22CD)) * 1000\n)\n\n# Ward-specific data for the map\nward <- dplyr::filter(ward_shp, LAD22NM == my_ward) %>%\n  dplyr::left_join(benefit, by = \"WD22CD\")\n\n# Format helpers\npal <- leaflet::colorNumeric(\"Greens\", domain = ward$benefit_value)\nthousands <- scales::label_comma()\n\nlabels <- sprintf(\n  \"<strong>%s</strong><br/>%s\",\n  ward$WD22NM, thousands(ward$benefit_value)\n) %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)\n\n# Map time!\nleaflet::leaflet() %>%\n  leaflet::addTiles() %>%\n  leaflet::addPolygons(\n    data = ward,\n    fillColor = ~pal(benefit_value),\n    weight = 2,\n    opacity = 0.9,\n    color = \"white\",\n    dashArray = \"3\",\n    fillOpacity = 0.9,\n    highlightOptions = leaflet::highlightOptions(\n      weight = 3,\n      color = \"#666\",\n      dashArray = \"\",\n      fillOpacity = 0.9,\n      bringToFront = TRUE),\n    label = labels,\n    labelOptions = leaflet::labelOptions(\n      style = list(\"font-weight\" = \"normal\", padding = \"3px 8px\"),\n      textsize = \"15px\",\n      direction = \"auto\")\n  ) %>%\n  leaflet::addLegend(\n    pal = pal,\n    values = ward$benefit_value,\n    opacity = 0.9,\n    title = NULL,\n    position = \"topleft\"\n  )"
