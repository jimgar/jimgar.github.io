In this post I will describe some of the ways I've found to conditionally include content in a Quarto-generate HTML document.

I'm using RStudio and the knitr rendering engine. If you know of Jupyter solutions please let me know! I will happily link to them for the disappointed Pythonistas who have ended up on my blog ;)

## Quarto

### {{{< include >}}} shortcode

This isn't conditional, but it is really useful. 

If you have company marketing boilerplate, or headers that start all of your reports, a neat solution is to keep these in their own qmd file and bring them into any other qmd using the [include shortcode](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html).

In your report you would use the code below

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
{{< include _content.qmd >}}
```

This is akin to manually copying and pasting in the contents of `content.qmd` prior to the report getting rendered.

We'll come back to the shortcode later.

### "Conditional" content

I put this one in quotes because to my mind it unfairly hogs the 'conditional' title.

This is for when you have parts of a document that you only want rendered (or not) to a specific **format**, such as HTML, PDF, etc.

If you're interested in this, here's the [Quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/conditional.html).

## Code flow

Most of the following examples follow the usual if/else structure.

I'll be referring to `params$my_boolean` throughout this section so let me take a moment to explain. 

In the YAML header of a Quarto document you can pass in parameters. These get stored in a list `params` that can be called throughout the document, just like any variables you make and keep in the global environment.

``` {.markdown}
---
params:
  my_boolean: FALSE
---
```

If you're using a Quarto project it is also possible to include variables in a root directory file `_variables.yml`. I'm not doing that here, but if it sounds appropriate for you, [here are the docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/variables.html).

### Inline code

You can conditionally execute inline code. If `my_boolean` is `TRUE` the example below results in a level 2 heading that says "Plots for mtcars". 

```{.markdown}
## Plots `r knitr::inline_expr('if (params$my_boolean) "for mtcars" else "for iris"')`
```

### In functions

Sometimes you just need a bit of perspective. Rather than something convoluted, do you just need to make a function with flow control of some kind?

```{r}
#| output: asis
#| echo: true
plotting_func <- function(dat, col1, col2) {
  
  if (params$my_boolean) {
    
    dat |>
      ggplot2::ggplot() +
      ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes({{ col1 }}, {{ col2 }}))
    
  } else {
    
    dat |>
      ggplot2::ggplot() +
      ggplot2::geom_boxplot(ggplot2::aes({{ col1 }}, {{ col2 }}))
    
  }
  
}
```

Or if the content is amenable to it, something like this

```{r}
#| output: asis
#| echo: true
plotting_func <- function(dat, col1, col2) {
  
  dat |>
    ggplot2::ggplot() +
    if (params$my_boolean) {
      ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes({{ col1 }}, {{ col2 }}))
    } else {
      ggplot2::geom_boxplot(ggplot2::aes({{ col1 }}, {{ col2 }}))
    }
  
}
```

You could put the function into a code block. Or you could hide it away in a folder `R/` and a script `functions.R`. That's useful if you write long ugly functions like me (lol), but also if you have multiple functions. In this case, you could just source the functions silently along with library calls at the start of the Quarto doc.

```{{r}}
#| include: false
library(dplyr)
library(downloadthis)
library(reactable)
source(file.path("R", "functions.R"))
```

If your content is too complicated for flow control inside of a function, then just put the content into separate functions in `functions.R`, `source` them as above, and use flow control in the Quarto doc

```{{r}}
if (params$my_boolean) {
  fancy_model_a(mtcars, wt, mpg) 
} else {
  fancy_model_b(iris, Species, Sepal.Length)
}
```

### `knitr::knit_child`

Saving the best for last, because this one is really cool!

Remember how I started with the `{{{< include >}}}` shortcode and said that it wasn't conditional?

``` {.markdown shortcodes="false"}
{{< include _content.qmd >}}
```

If anyone knows how to (simply) use the shortcode in a conditional manner I'd love to hear about it. In the meantime I consider the conditional version of this is using `knitr::knit_child`.

Let's say I make interactive plots of my data using Observable code blocks and keep this code in a separate Quarto doc `ojs-cells.qmd`. The code can be added to the main Quarto doc under certain conditions, as dictated by a boolean param `ojs_include` in the YAML header

```{{r}}
#| output: asis
if (params$ojs_include) { 
  
  cat(sep = "\n",
      knitr::knit_child(quiet = TRUE,
                        text = readr::read_file("ojs-cells.qmd")
      )
  )
  
}
```

What's happening here is 

1) `readr::read_file` brings in `ojs-cells.qmd` as a string
2) `cat` restores the line-by-line formatting and 'prints' the content
3) The `output: asis` chunk option means Quarto treats the content as raw markdown output 

Worth a mention - though not about conditionality - is this [demo](https://mickael.canouil.fr/posts/2023-03-05-quarto-auto-table-crossref/) by MickaÃ«l Canouil. It shows how the `knit_child` method can be called in a for loop to create *n* code chunks, and therefore *n* outputs (like tables and plots). This is great when you don't know how many plots there will be or even what they are called.
