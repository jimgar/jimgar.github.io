## Something new-ish

### Creative history

Longgg before I was a data analyst I studied fine art animation at Edinburgh College of Art. Before that I spent a few years drawing webcomics, and earlier still made maps and sprites for a fantasy-themed MMORPG server that my friends and I hosted. 

I failed out of the degree and stopped drawing. Work as a chef was so taxing that I didn't have the energy to keep sketching or making comics, so it slipped out of my life. As the years passed and life kept changing, I made music, recorded audiobooks, took microscopy photos, and eventually found creativity in gardening.

### Creative present

But I've always wanted to make pictures again. I drew a lot as a child and now in my mid-30s, sober for a year and a half, it feels really important to play in that space again. Like, **really** important.

Rather than try to "go back" and use pen and paper, I thought it would be easier, more freeing, to draw with the tools I'm interested in now. When I recently stumbled across the R workshop [ART FROM CODE](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/) by artist, educator, and general boon to the R community, [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/), I just knew this was it. Something I could (kind of) understand and at least give a go.

```{r crocus}

  ggplot() + 
  geom_jitter(aes(hwy, cty, size = year, colour = trans), shape = 16, alpha = 0.6, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(aes(hwy, cty, size = year / 2.5), colour = "orange", shape = 1, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(cyl, cty, colour = model), show.legend = FALSE, size = 5) +
  coord_polar() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 3) +
  scale_size(range = c(0, 10)) + 
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#056000", color = NA)) +
  ggforce::facet_zoom(xy = cyl == 6, zoom.data = TRUE)
```
