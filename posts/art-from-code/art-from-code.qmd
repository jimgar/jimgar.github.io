## Something new-ish

### Creative history

Longgg before I was a data analyst I studied fine art animation at Edinburgh College of Art. Before that I spent a few years drawing webcomics, and earlier still made maps and sprites for a fantasy-themed MMORPG server that my friends and I hosted. 

I failed out of the degree and stopped drawing. Work as a chef was so taxing that I didn't have the energy to keep sketching or making comics, so it slipped out of my life. As the years passed and life kept changing, I made music, recorded audiobooks, took microscopy photos, and eventually found creativity in gardening of all places.

### Creative present

But I've always wanted to make pictures again. I drew a lot as a child and now in my mid-30s, sober for a year and a half, it feels really important to play in that space again. Like, **really** important.

Rather than try to "go back" and use pen and paper, I thought it would be easier, more freeing, to draw with the tools I'm interested in now. When I recently stumbled across the R workshop [ART FROM CODE](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/) by the incredible artist, educator, and general boon to the R community, [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/), I just knew this was it. Something I could kind of understand and at least give a go.

What follows is my experience of learning how this stupid, beautiful programming language (that has changed my life so profoundly), can be used as something like a paint brush. Thank you Danielle, it means a lot!
