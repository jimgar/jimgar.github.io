I am a Technical Analyst at [Policy in Practice](https://policyinpractice.co.uk/). I mainly use R to smoothen our workflows, and deliver analytics projects for clients. In my personal time I love to boulder, garden at [Leith Community Croft](https://www.earth-in-common.org/), and hang with my wife and friends!
