Before that I spent a few years drawing webcomics, and earlier still made maps and sprites for a fantasy-themed MMORPG server that my friends and I hosted. \n\nI failed out of the degree and stopped drawing. Work as a chef was so taxing that I didn't have the energy to keep sketching or making comics, so it slipped out of my life. As the years passed and life kept changing, I made music, recorded audiobooks, took microscopy photos, and eventually found creativity in gardening of all places.\n\n### Creative present\n\nBut I've always wanted to make pictures again. I drew a lot as a child and now in my mid-30s, sober for a year and a half, it feels really important to play in that space again. Like, **really** important.\n\nRather than try to \"go back\" and use pen and paper, I thought it would be easier, more freeing, to draw with the tools I'm interested in now. When I recently stumbled across the R workshop [ART FROM CODE](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/) by the incredible artist, educator, and general boon to the R community, [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/), I just knew this was it. Something I could kind of understand and at least give a go.\n\nWhat follows is my experience of learning how this stupid, beautiful programming language (that has changed my life so profoundly), can be used as something like a paint brush. Thank you Danielle, it means a lot!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmtcars\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4           21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag       21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710          22.8   4 108.0  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive      21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout   18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant             18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\nDuster 360          14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4\nMerc 240D           24.4   4 146.7  62 3.69 3.190 20.00  1  0    4    2\nMerc 230            22.8   4 140.8  95 3.92 3.150 22.90  1  0    4    2\nMerc 280            19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C           17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4\nMerc 450SE          16.4   8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SL          17.3   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SLC         15.2   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00  0  0    3    3\nCadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4\nLincoln Continental 10.4   8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4\nChrysler Imperial   14.7   8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4\nFiat 128            32.4   4  78.7  66 4.08 2.200 19.47  1  1    4    1\nHonda Civic         30.4   4  75.7  52 4.93 1.615 18.52  1  1    4    2\nToyota Corolla      33.9   4  71.1  65 4.22 1.835 19.90  1  1    4    1\nToyota Corona       21.5   4 120.1  97 3.70 2.465 20.01  1  0    3    1\nDodge Challenger    15.5   8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87  0  0    3    2\nAMC Javelin         15.2   8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30  0  0    3    2\nCamaro Z28          13.3   8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4\nPontiac Firebird    19.2   8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05  0  0    3    2\nFiat X1-9           27.3   4  79.0  66 4.08 1.935 18.90  1  1    4    1\nPorsche 914-2       26.0   4 120.3  91 4.43 2.140 16.70  0  1    5    2\nLotus Europa        30.4   4  95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90  1  1    5    2\nFord Pantera L      15.8   8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50  0  1    5    4\nFerrari Dino        19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6\nMaserati Bora       15.0   8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60  0  1    5    8\nVolvo 142E          21.4   4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60  1  1    4    2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
