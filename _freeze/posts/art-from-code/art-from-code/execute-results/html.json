Before that I spent a few years drawing webcomics, and earlier still made maps and sprites for a fantasy-themed MMORPG server that my friends and I hosted. \n\nI failed out of the degree and stopped drawing. Work as a chef was so taxing that I didn't have the energy to keep sketching or making comics, so it slipped out of my life. As the years passed and life kept changing, I made music, recorded audiobooks, took microscopy photos, and eventually found creativity in gardening.\n\n### Creative present\n\nBut I've always wanted to make pictures again. I drew a lot as a child and now in my mid-30s, sober for a year and a half, it feels really important to play in that space again. Like, **really** important.\n\nRather than try to \"go back\" and use pen and paper, I thought it would be easier, more freeing, to draw with the tools I'm interested in now. When I recently stumbled across the R workshop [ART FROM CODE](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/) by artist, educator, and general boon to the R community, [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/), I just knew this was it. Something I could (kind of) understand and at least give a go.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg |>\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_jitter(aes(hwy, cty, size = year, colour = trans), shape = 16, alpha = 0.6, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(hwy, cty, size = year / 2.5), colour = \"orange\", shape = 1, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(aes(cyl, cty, colour = model), show.legend = FALSE, size = 5) +\n  coord_polar() + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = 3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(0, 10)) + \n  theme_void() +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#056000\", color = NA)) +\n  ggforce::facet_zoom(xy = cyl == 6, zoom.data = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](images/crocus.png)\n\n![](images/crocuses.jpg)\n\n:::\n\n",
